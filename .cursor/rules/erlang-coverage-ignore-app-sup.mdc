description: Ignore coverage for Erlang application and supervisor modules in reporting.
globs:
  - "**/*_app.erl"
  - "**/*_sup.erl"
---

Coverage reporting rule:

- Exclude modules matching `*_app.erl` and `*_sup.erl` from coverage expectations and summaries.
- Rationale: these modules are exercised in releases and are straightforward; excluding them avoids skewing test-time coverage metrics.
