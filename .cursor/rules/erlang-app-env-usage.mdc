Project rule: Application env usage in trello.erl
-------------------------------------------------

- In `trello.erl`, only read `trellang.trello_key` and `trellang.trello_token` from the application environment.
- Do NOT read board/list/member/label ids in `trello.erl`. The library API must be board-agnostic and support multiple boards concurrently.
- Pass identifiers such as `board_id`, `list_id`, `member_id`, `label_id` as function parameters in the public API.

Testing guidance:
- Test suites may read `trellang.board_id`, `trellang.list_id`, and similar values from `dev.config` and pass them into `trello` API functions.
- Keep the fixed ids confined to tests; do not bake test configuration into production/library code.

Rationale:
- Ensures the client is reusable across boards and contexts.
- Prevents hidden global coupling and facilitates concurrent multi-board usage.
